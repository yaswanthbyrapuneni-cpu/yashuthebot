/**
 * Framing guidance for the Virtual Try-On mirror.
 *
 * Vertex AI's virtual-try-on model expects a full-body, front-facing photo. The
 * kiosk webcam typically captures a head-and-shoulders crop instead, and the
 * model then renders a full-length garment with no body to place it on -- which
 * is what produced sarees floating above the customer's head.
 *
 * Face size is a reliable proxy for distance: the closer someone stands, the
 * more of the frame their face occupies. These thresholds are expressed as a
 * fraction of frame height so they hold at any resolution.
